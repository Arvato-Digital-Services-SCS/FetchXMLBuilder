    <summary>Build FetchXML queries. Investigate data. Update views. Get code. Empower yourself to achieve more.</summary>
    <description>
      The tool will assist in three major areas:

      1. Constructing FetchXML in ways that Advanced Find cannot
      - aggregates
      - outer joins
      - complex "not-in"-queries
      - attributes from multi-level linked entities
      - update existing views with altered queries

      2. Querying CRM for information not (easily) found in the CRM UI
      - system / internal entities
      - attributes hidden in CRM UI
      - join on other fields than relationships

      3. Developer assistance
      - Generate C# QueryExpression code from fetch xml
      - Generate OData query string from fetch xml
      - Generate SQL, JavaScript and C# stubs for queries
      - Easy to use UI to compose queries for reports in CRM

      The tool reads metadata from CRM to assist with selecting entities, attributes, relations and to perform validation of condition values.

      To make it even more appealing, there is also the possibility to have it show "Friendly names", which will replace the technical names of entities and attributes with their display names in the users' currently selected language, much like Advanced Find does.
